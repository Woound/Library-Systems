# Library-Systems
## Introduction

The Library-System project is designed to create a digital library system that allows for book management, borrowing and returning. Initially, I'll start with a non-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) version and then proceed to an OOP-based implementation for comparison and understanding.

## Features

- **Non-OOP Version**:
  - Basic book management (addition, removal, listing).
  - Borrowing and returning books.

- **OOP Version** (planned):
  - Enhanced organization using Object-Oriented Programming principles.
  - Improved modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
